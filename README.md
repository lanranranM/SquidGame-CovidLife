# SquidGame-CovidLife

The game takes place in the world of the famous Korean TV series "Squid Game". Here, you are a staff member guarding at the gate of the university. Many students come in every day. Some wear masks, some don't. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, you are responsible for preventing students who do not wear masks from entering the campus. Instead of using guns, you will use a magic spell to temporarily turn unmasked students into cats without hurting them. Do not cast spells on students who wear masks, and do not allow students who do not wear masks to come in, or you lose! Try it out!
