A small present!

The web version of *SquidGame in CovidLife*.



### Deployment

#### Deploy on a server

Just upload everything to the server and access with url.

#### Deploy locally

First, make sure you have these two things installed:

1. **node.js**: download from https://nodejs.org/en/

2. **Anywhere**: after node.js is installed, open a terminal, type

   ```shell
   npm install anywhere
   ```

Then, open a terminal at this web folder, and type `anywhere`. A browser tab should pop up with the game.
